# ComplexNumbers
This python file makes a complex class of its own...

The program takes two complex numbers each in a seperate line written by two spaced integers(first one real part and second imaginary)
The program returns addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus of first and second number each in seperate line.

The program uses builtin methods written like "__xyz__" and overrides them. These methods are called by operators usually.
